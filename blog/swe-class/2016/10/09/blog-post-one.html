    <h3 id="getting-acquainted">Getting Acquainted</h3>
<p>In this first post, I wanted to introduce myself as a software engineer, and the project on which my team and I will be reporting on for our Software Engineering class for this Fall 2016 Semester. I am a Junior at Drew University majoring in Computer Science and Economics with a deep interest in data analytics. I interned this past summer in Boston with Fidelity Investments’ Quantitative Technology group, and the summer prior to that with Corning Incorporated’s Information Security group. Now, in my Software Engineering class, I will be working with a team of students to leverage our collective knowledge and experience to build a real-world software application for a client from Drew University.</p>

<h3 id="our-client">Our Client</h3>
<p>Our client is a sociology professor at Drew who has spearheaded efforts to provide a directory of services and activities to those new and old in the community of Orange, New Jersey. From arts and festivals, to child services and clinics, our client has collected a vast amount of information from her community in an effort to promote local businesses, and aid newcomers in finding what they need when they need it.</p>

<h3 id="our-challenge">Our Challenge</h3>
<p>Our client has enlisted our services to build a rich mobile application that can display the wealth of information in her existing database of business and service providers in Orange to a wide audience. The challenge is not only to create a full-featured, multi-platform application that can deliver this information, but also a low-tech component that intermediaries can use to ‘export’ addresses, contacts, and other information to emails, texts, or other media for users without a smartphone. We are also pushing for a multi-lingual interface as this would dramatically increase the user-base and usefulness of the application in its intended context.</p>

<h3 id="the-framework">The Framework</h3>
<p>We chose <a href="http://ionic.io">Ionic Framework</a> in part because it was the framework of choice for our original mapping protocol, Geotagger. While we may be using a different mapping protocol, the Ionic framework is a perfect choice for our use-case as we are able to build a single application that can be deployed on the web, and both major mobile platforms: iOS and Android.</p>

<h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<p>So far, we have managed to split our workload up according to the three major components of the application resulting in a View Team, a Model Team, and a Controller Team, each responsible for engineering that particular component in conjunction with the remaining two teams. The three teams are all present at customer meetings with a spokesperson or business analyst of sorts from each so that their questions and concerns are addressed in customer meetings and amongst team members</p>

<h3 id="forward-outlook">Forward Outlook</h3>
<p>Now that we have gathered the main requirements from our customer, the View Team of which I am a part hopes to create a mock-interface for the customer to demo and provide feedback. We also hope to begin integrating some of the controller logic into the application depending on the progress of that team.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading the first post, and be sure to come back for more over the coming weeks!</p>
