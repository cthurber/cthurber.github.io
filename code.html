					<li class="post_description">In the fall of 2015, Drew Economics Professor <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.drew.edu/ebs/faculty/giandomenico-sarolli/">GianDomenico Sarolli</a> and Economics student <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richa-patel-82925084">Richa Patel</a> came to myself and fellow developer <a class="linkedin" href="http://iamdanielgiraldo.com">Danny Giraldo</a> with an idea: a brand new research platform designed specifically to measure risk tolerance or aversion in every-day people. While other platforms already existed, they were expensive, outdated, and lacking many of the features our clients desired. So, together we designed a platform that hosts a series of games rooted in measuring risk aversion ranging from a balloon that fills with cash to a Deal or No Deal style game. DrewLab will live on at Drew to encourage further collaboration between Drew's Economics and Computer Science students to create new games and expand the platform for years to come.

					<li class="post_description">
						As part of <a class="source" href="https://www.drew.edu/ebs/wall…">Drew's Wall Street Semester</a>, my classmates and I have been competing in a virtual stock trading game that lasts for the duration of the semester. Strategies have ranged from buying high-volatility ETFs, others rooted in blue chips, and some simply have opted not to trade at all. I was addicted from the start, and since then I have been developing a program to trade based on information ranging from faster pricing data from Bloomberg, to sentiment analysis of tweets about a wide variety of companies on twitter. Strat-Box is designed to make trades on our class's MarketWatch-based virtual game in the hopes of claiming first place by the end of the semester. May the best strat win!

					<li class="post_description">WhatTrack.com provides track predictions for all New Jersey Transit trains departing Penn Station so you can avoid the hoard and catch your train. This project has seen me from the dark days of using CSV spreadsheets for data storage and BASH scripts for content delivery, all the way through to a clean, mature, SQL and Flask-based web application. Check it out at <u><a class="source" href="https://whattrack.com">whattrack.com</a></u> or tweet your train number to <u><a class="source" href="https://twitter.com/whattrackis">@whattrackis on Twitter</a></u>, and I hope you beat the rush to the track and get the perfect seat!

I had also been looking into a webpage API for Python that a friend of my found called <a class="source" href="http://splinter.readthedocs.org/">Splinter</a>. I decided this would be a perfect time to try it out, so I created this simple program that iterates through each user ID and records all valid names and ids it finds in a CSV file.

					<li class="post_description">
					Sometimes we don't like the things we tweet. A few friends of mine with thousands of tweets dating back well into their wonderfully angsty teenage years wondered if there was a way to take back all of those strange thoughts and opinions they once felt so strongly about. TweetPurge is a simple, open-source Python program that lets users lookup keywords from a Twitter archive CSV file, and delete any tweet they find with its corresponding unique ID. Angsty tweets: be gone.

					VirusTotal's website provides an easily searchable set of scanned MD5 and SHA hashes to get more information on potentially malicious files and websites. It's API is great, but no tool available had a quick and easy way to perform multiple lookups with a simple spreadsheet of hashes. I forked an <u><a class="source" href="https://github.com/Xen0ph0n/VirusTotal_API_Tool">existing code repository</a></u> from <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cybersec">Chris Clark</a> of Palo Alto Networks and <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=5074541">Adam Meyers</a> of CrowdStrike to add in a multiple hash lookup feature using a CSV file as input. I also added in the ability to throttle the API requests to keep the free version working for those without a premium key.
