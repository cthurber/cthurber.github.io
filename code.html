					<li class="post_tag">Python Command Line Tool // <a class="source" href="https://github.com/cthurber/VirusTotal_API_Tool">Fork it on Github</a> </li>
					<li class="post_description">VirusTotal's website provides an easily searchable set of scanned MD5 and SHA hashes to get more information on potentially malicious files and websites. It's API is great, but no tool available had a quick and easy way to perform multiple lookups with a simple spreadsheet of hashes. So, that's exactly what I did. I forked <u><a class="source" href="https://github.com/Xen0ph0n/VirusTotal_API_Tool">this repository</a></u> from <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cybersec">Chris Clark</a> of Palo Alto Networks and <a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=5074541">Adam Meyers</a> of CrowdStrike to add in a multiple hash lookup feature using a CSV file as input. I also added in the ability to throttle the AIP requests to keep the free version working for those without an AIP key.</li>

					<li class="post_tag">Python + Twitter API // <a class="source" href="https://github.com/cthurber/WhatTrack">Fork it on Github</a> or <a class="source" href="http://twitter.com/whattrackis">Try it out</a></li>
					<li class="post_description">While waiting for a 5 PM train in New York's Penn Station, I realized I would much rather wait on the platform instead of in the concourse packed full of commuters waiting to stampede when their track flashes onto the departure board. To fix this problem, I created a Twitter account. To use it, all you have to do is tweet any New Jersey Transit train number and mention "whattrackis." Within a minute, it'll tweet back with the platform the train is most likely to depart from.</li>

					<li class="post_tag">Java Game // <a class="source" href="https://github.com/emhill/DrewSuperMario">Fork it on GitHub</a> </li>
					<li class="post_description">For the final project of the year, our Spring (2015) Computer Science Class all contributed to different features for an open-source Mario game our professor found online. I managed to add a coin counter that integrated with existing code to ensure coins were awarded for everything from picking them up, to smashing mystery blocks.</li>
