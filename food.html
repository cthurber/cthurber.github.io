					<li class="post_description">Paolo Meregalli and his staff will treat you to arguably one of the best dining experiences you will ever have. This small but carefully crafted menu is complimented by a list of wines, from the Meregalli family of course, that can be paired with each dish. The result is an unbelievable, almost euphoric meal that words cannot accurately describe. And don't worry: Their staff pays close attention to your appetite and your portion size to make sure you have just enough room for dessert. Without a doubt, try the Tiramisu or the Affogato.</li>

					<li class="post_description">This casual venue was one of my last stops in the city before heading home, and my first on a recent visit with a friend. This cozy tavern has everything from juicy friend chicken and Old Bay seasoned fries to dirty Arnold Palmers and delicious burgers. It makes for a great spot around sunset as it's not a far walk from a great view of the Manhattan skyline at sunset from Buschwick Inlet Park, and it certainly doesn't break the bank.</li>

					<li class="post_description">Popcorn is offered "on the house." The salmon, though done slightly rarer than I'm used to, was full of delicious flavor and The Greens, Sprouts &amp; Herbs were also a great dish to split, even as a half portion. The real star of the show was the S'more for dessert: Four perfectly roasted marshmallows atop a slab of thick chocolate mousse, with four graham crackers to scoop it all in. Access to the local 1 train right outside the door was also a huge plus.</li>

					<li class="post_description">This uniquely furnished bar and restaurant offers the perfect ambience in dim, but warm lighting. I chose the Hangar Steak, along with polenta, brussels sprouts, and roasted squash. Great wine and unforgettable service make Saxton + Parole a truly distinct experience on a night out. Don't forget to try the cheesecake for dessert!</li>

					<li class="post_description">An extensive selection of bourbon and wine, combined with rich, authentic Southern dishes with a New York twist makes for a delicious evening. I will definitely be returning to try some more bourbon and enjoy the great service all over again.</li>

					<li class="post_description">A wonderful wine selection paired with carefully crafted dishes all set in a small but cozy atmosphere perfect for a date. Try a glass of the sparkling Cava along with the braised short ribs, and don't forget dessert. (Really: don't forget it!)</li>

					<li class="post_description">Amazing french cuisine with an intimate, cozy environment and lively wait staff. They do not accept reservations, and the wait in the lobby can get crowded, but the crowd is friendly making the time pass with ease. Grab a glass of wine, or choose from an extensive collection of champagne, and enjoy great French tapas in a cozy, casual, lively spot. </li>
